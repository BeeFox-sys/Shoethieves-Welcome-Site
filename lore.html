            Welcome to the lore channel!<br>
            In this channel, we discuss the lore of the team!<br>
            So thow out an idea! Tell us your favorite lore! Make something!
        </p>
        <h2>Experimental Rookie Protocol</h2>
        <p>We came up with some minor tweaks to how we create a new character from scratch that we want to try next time the Shoe Thieves get a rookie player! </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get excited! New friend!</li>
            <li>Everyone spends 60 minutes coming up with potential concepts for the character, in the vein of “a penguin who pitches for some reason” or “a black butch lesbian time traveller from the 20s”.<br>These don’t have to be one-liners, but save filling in all the details for later in the process! Post your idea in a single message containing the searchable phrase “[player name] Character Concept:” ie “Esme Ramsey Character Concept:” or “Holden Milk Character Concept:”</li>
            <li>Time’s up! Everyone takes a 30 minute break while volunteer(s) collate the ideas into a list!</li>
            <li>Reconvene, read over the list, and discuss! The goal here is to create a short list; see what concepts can be combined or otherwise reconciled! The more ideas we cram into a single character, the more well-rounded and weird they become, so it’s encouraged to do so.</li>
            <li>Pin the short list so folks who are offline can come back and see it! At this point anyone can take whichever concept(s) appeal most to them and work them into a talk page submission for the new player's wiki page. Working fast is encouraged; we can discuss and fill in details on an ongoing basis!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any of these steps might get revised or junked in the future if it turns out they don’t work for us. Thanks for participating in this experiment!</p>

            📖 Our wiki (lovingly under construction at all times) has some lore that can help answer questions like "who is pine?" and "beasley is a dog??" The season pages are usually up to date to keep track of Weather Events too! <a href="https://blaseball.fandom.com/wiki/Charleston_Shoe_Thieves"></a>Vist the wiki</a>

            🤝Lore is mostly decided through community storytelling, yes-anding, and an understanding that there are multiple ways to participate in the cultural event of blaseball! We keep an active Lore Doc going and you can read and add ideas to it as well! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ewZk2i9-_Last2EXSIw8fAI3jxyzAyI5PydrufGgT0U/edit?usp=sharing">You can check that out here!</a>
